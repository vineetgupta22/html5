# [HTML5]

HTML5 is a Object Oriented Programming that helps you build fast, valid and cross browser websites.

After going through many CMS and Web Templates, I decided to create a PHP5 based Object of HTML5 to render fastly html web Page. It does not impose a specific development framework, so you're free to architect your code in the way that you want.

## Quick start

Clone the git repo - `git clone git://github.com/vineetgupta22/html5.git' - or [download it](https://github.com/vineetgupta22/html5/tarball/master)


## Objective of HTML5

To provide easy and fast way to generate the valid html5 web page with all available things.

## Division of HTML5 Elements

We had divided HTML5 in various groups to understand it more easily and the groups are:

### 1. Root Element

The HTML root element (<html>) represents the root of an HTML or XHTML document. All other elements must be descendants of this element. Since the <html> element is the first in a document other than comments, it is called the root element. Although this tag can be implied, or not required, with HTML, it is required to be opened and closed in XHTML. If we see parent and child relationship then root element should be Parent and others are child and child of child.

### 2. Head and Body Element

The Parent HTML has two children i.e. head and body and all other elements must be children of either one Elements. The Element which is not a children of any of the above Element doesn't exits in HTML structure. So, I am giving them the name of Controlling Parents Elements as they become the major Controlling Elements of all other Elements

###3. Document Metadata Elements

The Next group of the Elements is Documents Meta Elements. The Document's Meta Elements are important part of any Page but they are optional also. The existance of these Elements doesn't depend on any of the other elements. These Metadata Elements helps to provide the visual effects to the view of the page and also help full to the Search Engines to Index Page according to the keywords used in Metadata Elements. The Elemnets which are included in Metadata Element are: 

1. Title

2. Base

3. Link

4. Meta

5. Style
